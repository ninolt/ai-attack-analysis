## Installation

### Python virtual environnement

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets

You can just run the first cell in the Jupyter notebook, but in case this doesn't work, you have to:

- Download the following files :
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icsdataset/hai/master/hai-20.07/test1.csv.gz
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icsdataset/hai/master/hai-20.07/test2.csv.gz
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icsdataset/hai/master/hai-20.07/train1.csv.gz
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icsdataset/hai/master/hai-20.07/train2.csv.gz

- Unzip them
- Place them in a "/data" folder, which should be right next to the jupyter file

## Starting the project
